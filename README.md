# Drivo Coding Challenge

### What do we expect from you

- Elegant code
- Efficient code
- Semantically correct ts/js
- Semantically correct css/css-in-js
- Responsive UI
- Unit tests
- Containerisation

We would like to see you implement a full stack web application comprised of:

- a backend api (we use node js and postgresql)
- a frontend application (we use react)

The application is comprised of two screens:

#### Screen 1: Booking a car park

This screen is used to create a booking. Here is the information that we need to create a booking:

- Name
- E-mail
- Licence plate
- Start Date
- End date

It needs to be responsive as it would targets the public.

#### Screen 2: Displaying the bookings

This screen is used to display the list of bookings.

It does not necessarily need to be responsive for the purpose of this exercise.

#### Expectations

- Share a short **screen recording** (~30 seconds) of you using this application.
- Although we won’t assess your UI design choices, we want to assess your skills when it comes to styling so make sure to **style the application** so that you are happy to present it.
- You are encouraged to treat this as if you were creating a pull request to be reviewed by your peers prior to a merge to **production**.

We welcome you to use the technology you are the most familiar with.
we don’t want you to spend more time than you should on the exercise.

Make sure to:

- That the reviewer is able to start your project easily after pulling the repo;
- Write some documentation in the Readme and explain the choices you have made;
- Let us know roughly how much time you had spent on your solution;
- Also let us know what you would have added if you had more time; and
- Send us a link to your repository (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket) once you are ready.
